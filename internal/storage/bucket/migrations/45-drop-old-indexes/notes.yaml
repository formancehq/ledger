name: Drop Old Indexes (5/5)
description: |
  Drop all old suboptimal indexes that have been replaced by new optimized indexes
  created in migrations 41-44. This final step completes the index optimization process.

changes:
  moves_table:
    - action: "DROP"
      old_indexes:
        - "moves_post_commit_volumes"
        - "moves_effective_post_commit_volumes"
      reason: "Replaced by idx_moves_pit_insertion and idx_moves_pit_effective in migrations 41-42"

  accounts_metadata_table:
    - action: "DROP"
      old_index: "accounts_metadata_revisions"
      reason: "Replaced by idx_accounts_metadata_pit in migration 43"

  transactions_metadata_table:
    - action: "DROP"
      old_index: "transactions_metadata_revisions"
      reason: "Replaced by idx_transactions_metadata_pit in migration 44"

  accounts_volumes_table:
    - action: "DROP"
      old_index: "accounts_volumes_idx"
      reason: "Redundant - PRIMARY KEY already covers this pattern"

migration_safety:
  - "Old indexes are dropped only AFTER all new indexes are created"
  - "Ensures no performance degradation during migration"
  - "No data modification - only removes redundant index structures"
