# Formance Ledger

Formance Ledger (fka numary) is a programmable financial ledger that provides a foundation for money-moving applications. The ledger provides atomic multi-postings transactions and is programmable in [Numscript](doc:machine-instructions), a built-in language dedicated to money movements. It can be used either as a standalone micro-service or as part of the greater Formance Stack, and will shine for apps that require a lot of custom, money-moving code, e.g:

- E-commerce with complex payments flows, payments splitting, such as marketplaces
- Company-issued currencies systems, e.g. Twitch Bits
- In-game currencies, inventories and trading systems, e.g. Fortnite V-Bucks
- Payment gateways using non-standard assets, e.g. learning credits
- Local currencies and complementary finance

Formance Ledger works as a standalone binary, the latest of which can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/formancehq/ledger/releases). You can move the binary to any executable path, such as to `/usr/local/bin`. Installations using brew, apt, yum or docker are also [available](https://docs.formance.com/docs/installation-1).
