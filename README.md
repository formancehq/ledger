### Formance Ledger
=======
# Formance Ledger
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Formance Ledger \(fka numary\) is a programmable financial ledger that provides a foundation for money\-moving applications. The ledger provides atomic multi\-postings transactions and is programmable in \[Numscript\]\(doc:machine\-instructions\), a built\-in language dedicated to money movements. It can be used either as a standalone micro\-service or as part of the greater Formance Stack, and will shine for apps that require a lot of custom, money\-moving code, e.g:

- E\-commerce with complex payments flows, payments splitting, such as marketplaces
- Company\-issued currencies systems, e.g. Twitch Bits
- In\-game currencies, inventories and trading systems, e.g. Fortnite V\-Bucks
- Payment gateways using non\-standard assets, e.g. learning credits
- Local currencies and complementary finance

## Getting started

Formance Ledger works as a standalone binary, the latest of which can be downloaded from the \[releases page\]\(https://github.com/formancehq/ledger/releases\). You can move the binary to any executable path, such as to \`/usr/local/bin\`. Installations using brew, apt, yum or docker are also \[available\]\(https://docs.formance.com/docs/installation-1\).

```
docker compose up -d

# Submit a first transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:3068/quickstart/transactions -d '{"postings": [{"source": "world", "destination": "bank", "amount": 100, "asset": "USD"}]}'

# Get the balances of drivers:042
