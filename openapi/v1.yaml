              - `details`: contains a URL. When there is an error parsing Numscript, the result can be difficult to read—the provided URL will render the error in an easy-to-read format.
              - `errorCode` and `error_code` (deprecated): contains the string code of the error
              - `errorMessage` and `error_message` (deprecated): contains a human-readable indication of what went wrong, for example that an account had insufficient funds, or that there was an error in the provided Numscript.
